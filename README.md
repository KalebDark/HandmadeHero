# HandmadeHero
HandmadeHero

This is my version of the C++ source for Casey Muratori's HandmadeHero tutorial
Written for the Visual Studio 2013 IDE

This is not quite Casey code, I have added my own flavourings to taste.

This is just for fun, and just to go back and re-acquaint with C++ and Win32.
I'll not be bothering with other platforms.
